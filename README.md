The page is used by viewing information about myself in the 'about me' section, my work in the 'my work' section and my contact information in the 'contact' section. There is a nav bar in the header with links that will jump to that section of the page when clicked. In addition the images of my projects contain links to the deployed pages that can be accessed simply by clicking on them.
